EXPLANATION 
Taking the 1st box, it consists of only a three. The 2nd column already contains a one; one of the two blanks in the 1st column must be filled using a one.  Since the 2nd row already has a 1, the 1st blank of the 1st column must be a 1. The remaining 2 boxes the 1st one is 2 and the next one 4. In the second 2x2 box 3 and 1 are already given so 2 and 4 can be filled accordingly. The 4th column of the 1st row is filled with 4 and the other with a 2.In the next 2x2 box also a 3 and a 1 is given, since in the 2ed column all the 3 numbers except 4 already exist, it must be filled with a 4, and the other blank in the 4th column must be filled with a 2. Based on all these values, the 4th 2x2 table can be filled easily. The 3rd column already contains a 3 and 2, and the 3rd row already contains a 3 and 2. The 1st blank is one, and the last blank is 2.The next 2 blanks are 4 and 3, respectively.Since the question does not have any 2s or 4s all 2s and 4s can be swapped.
